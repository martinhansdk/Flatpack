## Long Description

### Streamline Your Laser Cutting Workflow

Flatpack simplifies exporting flat faces from Fusion 360 to DXF and SVG files for laser cutting, CNC routing, and other fabrication processes. No more creating sketches for every face you want to export!

### Key Features

** Simplified Workflow**
- Export faces directly without creating sketches
- Select multiple faces and export to a single file
- Settings are saved with your document for easy re-export

** Smart Color Coding**
- Outer edges and inner holes use different colors
- Cut holes first to prevent material shifting
- Works perfectly with most laser cutter software

** Automatic Layout**
- Parts are automatically oriented for efficient cutting
- Organized in a horizontal row with spacing
- No manual arrangement needed

** Perfect for Iterations**
- Settings persist in your document
- Re-export after design changes with one click
- Maintains face selections automatically

** Flexible Export Options**
- Export to DXF or SVG format
- Adjustable curve conversion tolerance
- Compatible with most CAM software

### Who Is This For?

- **Makers & Hobbyists** creating laser-cut projects
- **Product Designers** prototyping with sheet materials
- **Engineers** exporting parts for fabrication
- **Anyone** tired of Fusion 360's built-in DXF export workflow

### How It Works

1. Select the flat faces you want to export
2. Choose your output file and format (.dxf or .svg)
3. Click OK - done!

Curves are automatically converted to line segments with adjustable precision. Inner holes and outer edges are color-coded for easy identification in your cutting software.
