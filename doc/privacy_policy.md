# Flatpack Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026

## Data Collection

Flatpack does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information to external servers or the add-in developer.

## Data Storage

Flatpack stores the following information **locally within your Fusion 360 document**:
- Selected face references
- Output filename preference
- Conversion tolerance settings

This data is stored using Fusion 360's built-in attribute system and is:
- Saved in your Fusion 360 document
- Synchronized with Autodesk's cloud if you use cloud storage
- Never transmitted to the Flatpack developer
- Never transmitted to any third-party services

## Autodesk Data

When you use Fusion 360's cloud storage, your documents (including Flatpack's saved settings) are subject to [Autodesk's Privacy Policy](https://www.autodesk.com/company/legal-notices-trademarks/privacy-statement).

## No External Communication

Flatpack does not:
- Send any data over the internet
- Contact any external servers
- Include any telemetry or analytics
- Track your usage in any way
- Collect crash reports
- Display advertisements

## File Output

When you export faces to DXF or SVG files:
- Files are saved to your local computer only
- You control where files are saved
- No copies are sent to the developer or any service

## Third-Party Services

Flatpack does not integrate with or use any third-party services.

## Open Source

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be:
- Published in the add-in's documentation
- Available on the GitHub repository
- Noted in the release notes

## Contact

For privacy-related questions or concerns:
- Open an issue: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/martinhansdk/Flatpack/issues)

## Your Rights

Since Flatpack does not collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. All settings are stored locally in your Fusion 360 documents under your control.

You can remove all Flatpack data by:
1. Uninstalling the add-in from Fusion 360
2. Deleting the Flatpack.bundle folder from your add-ins directory

Settings stored in individual documents will remain in those documents but will have no effect without the add-in installed.
